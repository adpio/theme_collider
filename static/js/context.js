Robotic process automation (RPA) provides organizations with the ability to automate processes across  any computer systems, including legacy systems and custom programs, by mimicking human interaction with the software. This is of particular relevance for organizations that either have a large amount of repeatable processes, rely on many legacy systems, or struggle to integrate a wide range of systems as the result of mergers and acquisitions.</p><p>Furthermore, RPA solutions allow for processes to be completed faster, cheaper and to eliminates human error. Organizations have successfully implemented RPA for an increase in throughput, capacity, and the quality of customer service.</p><p>Examples of use include assisting call center agents perform queries involving multiple databases in order to serve the needs of their clients, or fully automating backend processes needed to open new accounts. The wide applications of use, and cost savings approaching a 10x improvement over a human operator, make RPA particularly appealing to many organizations. </p>",
